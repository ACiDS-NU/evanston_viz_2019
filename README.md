# Evanston_Viz_2019

A project to analyze, visualize, and communicate City of Evanston Open Data (in response to call for submissions to the [Love Data Week 2019 contest](https://sites.northwestern.edu/lovedataweek/contest/)). Ideally, the visuals created here will tell a coherent story to be printed for the competition.
